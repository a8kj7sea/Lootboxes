# Lootboxes Plugin   

A simple project made with love for my friend to help him understand how lootboxes work and how physics-based collisions are handled

## Features:  
- Customizable lootboxes  
- Basic physics-based collision mechanics  
- Easy-to-understand implementation  

# TODO:

> 2. Create managers for handling the lootbox system. :white_check_mark: 
> 3. Implement the related commands for managing lootboxes. 
> 4. Check JSON values and ensure proper handling (e.g., parsing, validation). 
> 5. Remove values after an entity dies. :white_check_mark: 
> 6. On reload:
>    - Ensure all tasks are cancelled.
